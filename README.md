## Continous integration 
Each time a push to the master branch is done, a github action will be run, that builds the project and checks all the results from the JUnit unit tests. The test results will be published in a test report and if there are failing unit tests, the build will fail. 

The continous integration can be seen on the [Actions tab](https://github.com/SethOberg/RPG_Heroes/actions).

# RPG_Heroes

## Continous integration 
Each time a push to the master branch is done, a github action will be run, that builds the project and checks all the results from the junit unit tests. The test results will be shown in a test report and if there are failing unit tests, the build will fail and the failed tests will be shown. 

The continous integration can be seen on the "Actions" tab.
